	The-AIO host test automation script (by PEteam)

These shell scripts are intended to automate androbench test including summarizing result and sending result to users. Still, there are some parts needed to be improved (such as error handling). If you find some bug, don't hesiate to modify it. Thank you.

INSTALLATION & HOW TO START
 These are small shell script files, which means you don't have to install them. Just launch it!
 
 svn checkout 

 sudo ./run_androbench_test_all.sh   (default test loop count : 3)
 sudo ./run_androbench_test_all.sh -i 2  (do Androbench test twice)
 sudo ./run_androbench_test_all.sh -r hm.kim@the-aio.com (it executes test 3 times and send the result to "hm.kim@the-aio.com")
